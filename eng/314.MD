# What is the role played by beauty in relation to love, transcendence, God? - Francis Answers - 168

Location: Barcelona

You said in Barcelona that compassion is one of the aspects of love. I would like to ask which is the role played by beauty in relation to love, transcendence, God. Thanks

Dear Carolina,

The Garden of Eden, the transcendent realm, has many gates.

The way that leads to the gate of Truth is indicated by rational, logical, intelligent concepts. The street that leads to the gate of Love is paved with compassionate, all-including, non-judgmental feelings. The path that leads to the gate of beauty is adorned by harmonious, balanced, rhythmical sense perceptions. There are many more gates, such as the gate of Laughter and Humor, the gate of Creativity, the gate of Eternity, the gate of Peaceâ€¦Some are highly visible from afar, others are hidden, known only by a few. Many gates, only one Garden.

Love,

Francis
