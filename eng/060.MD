Question: Does the desire to know indicate that one is ready and capable of knowing or Is it necessary to prepare the mind to receive the teachings of liberation?

Dear Dede,

Yes, the desire to know our true Self is the single most important prerequisite for the realization of the Absolute. Whatever transforming preparatory steps the mind needs to go through will appear spontaneously in the course of a sadhana which is driven by a burning desire for the Truth. These steps may include the serendipitous encounters with sacred texts or with a guru, the elimination of belief systems through understanding, the release of tensions in the body, and many other events occurring in the world around us.

Love, Francis
