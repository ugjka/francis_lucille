# Francis Answers - 223 - What is the difference between you and me?

Name: Javier   

Location: Vitoria   

Question: Dear Francis, first sorry for my English, I love the path you teach and a question comes to the mind. what is really the difference between you and me? it is true that when a negative thought comes you simply disidentify with it and welcome, taking clear that it is only a temporary manifestation of the consciouness, a form arising? love.

Dear Javier,

There is no difference whatsoever between you and me, if by "you" and "me" you mean the consciousness which is perceiving these words right now.

Love,

Francis
