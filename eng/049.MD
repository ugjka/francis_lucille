>_Francis, we are taught that the truth of who we are is the awareness right here right now which is aware of these words, this page. Clearly, awareness or the sense of existence, or the sense that I am -- whatever words we use-- is present because it is felt directly: I am and I know that I am. However, that doesn't help me much. I still don't feel free. How may I free myself from the sense of being an individual, suffering "I am"?_

Answer: In your question, you are referring to two distinct "I"s

1. "the awareness right here right now which is aware of these words,...awareness or the sense of existence, or the sense that I am"

2. "an individual, suffering "I am"

You also mention that Nr 1 "is felt directly". By whom? By Nr 1 or by Nr 2? The use of the word "directly" seems to indicate that it is felt by Nr 1.

And, more generally, which one perceives, and which one is perceived? Which one of those two is you?

If you say Nr 2 you loose, if you say Nr 1 you win - big time. What say you?

Love,

Francis
