Question: Hello If this life is a dream, an illusion, then what are your views about the year 2012 &amp; catastrophic events to happen for planet earth? i mean shouldn't we still play the game &amp; do something about it? Cheers Victor

Dear Victor,

I do whatever I can to make this dream a better dream, not because I feel I have to, but because I enjoy doing it. If we would all try to do the same, it would be a very sweet dream. Too sweet perhaps, like American chocolate?

All is well and unfolding as it should (Robert Adams). We'll all be fine at the end.

Love,

Francis
