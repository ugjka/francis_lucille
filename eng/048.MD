>After closing eye's visualising and feeling body parts in a sequence,at times unseen images (every time new) appears, stays for some moments and then vanishes gradually like wind is blowing particles of sand, then I am reminded that I am to complete visulisation of remaing parts of my body.Initially it was quite disturbing,Now It is not, but I have to wait to continue further.What it is? and why it happens?

Dear Chandram,

You are asking a question about a spiritual practice which I haven't recommended. You should ask the teacher who has prescribed it to you.

Love,
