# Francis Answers - 222 - How can one even know that one is in the absolute state?

>Dear Francis, How can one even know that one is in the absolute state? Such knowledge remains relative, for it exists only in contrast with its opposite, the relative state. Thus it seems that the absolute state is somehow a non-state, for it can have no opposite. It also seems that it cannot be gained anew, for what can be gained anew would still have an opposite. If it cannot be gained anew, what is the use in pursuing it? Is such pursuit necessary to realize that indeed there was nothing ever to pursue and to gain? Is such knowledge, such firm conviction, true liberation? Thank you, Jay

Dear Jay,

One is always in the absolute state, knowingly or unknowingly, for there is nothing else. To be knowingly in the absolute state means to be happy, content and at peace without the slightest restriction. What is said here has to be understood experientially, not theoretically. Theoretically, you are right. The use in pursuing a state? No use at all. The use in pursuing the truth about our real nature? Happiness, plain and simple. The firm conviction that "there was nothing ever to pursue and to gain" is not liberation, as long as there is the slightest sense of lack. However, it is an important milestone on the path to it.

With love,

Francis
