Question: Dear Francis, Where do thoughts originate? How do they come to appear in this mind that the seeming I experiences? With love and thanks, Kathy









&nbsp;

Dear Katherine,










  












They originate in you, exist in you, vanish in you. But whatever appears in you cannot limit you. Since everything you will ever know has to appear in you, you can never know that you are limited. Therefore your belief that you are a limited consciousness or &quot;mind&quot; is without foundation.










  












Love,










Francis
