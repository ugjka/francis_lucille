# Francis Answers - 196 - How to practice self-inquiry.

Location: Maryland 

Question: Hello: I am not sure how to practice Atma Vichara or Self Enquiry. Do I keep asking myself the question "Who Am I" or "What am I" everytime I lose the I-I conciousness? 

**Do that every time you believe to have strong evidence that you are a limited consciousness, or a body-mind, simply by looking at the evidence you have, be it on the conceptual level or on the feeling level.**

 **** 

Do I practice this technique in meditation in the morning and the evening or do I try to practice all the time? 

When I practice a little while, I feel peace, but this only lasts a short time. Do I practice the "What Am I" like a mantra or just when I experience more of body comciousness or Ego conciousness?

**Practice only when you feel dissatisfaction, a sense of lack or of misery. If you are at peace, don't try to fix it.**

 Does this practice help attain extinction of the ego? 

**Yes. It is the first step. It has to be continued until you truly think and feel that you don't know that consciousness is limited to or by your mind-body.**

I am afraid not to practice spiritual discipline because the discipline usually makes me want to experience conciousness at a more intense level. I know Ramakrishna said a devotee\'s desire to experience God or truth should be as intense as a man who has his head held underwater desiring to breathe air. Doesnt the desire to experience truth grow with the practice of spiritual discipline? 

**Yes, it does, but only in so far as the practice leads to glimpses of our Reality. These glimpses are the real "desire boosters". Don't think of your inquiry as  a practice such as japa, but as an investigation. You don't need to repeat "what am I?",**

**"what am I?",**

**"what am I?" like a parrot, but rather to be genuinely interested in finding out your real self, just as a detective is using all means at his disposal to find a criminal, which he does without waisting his time constantly repeating "who did it?"**

I feel very glad to have found your guidance and like you very much. Walter Newell

**Nice. Love,**
