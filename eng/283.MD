# Does the individual have any choice about enlightenment? - Francis Answers - 150

Question:

>Satyan Nadeen is quoted as saying that enlightment is a lottery. My question is whether attaining a sustained awakened state has anything to do with intention, devotion, or earnest effort? Does the individual have any choice about it at all?

Dear Joanna,

Enlightenment is the result of our desire for it. The only obstacle to enlightenment is our desire for something else than enlightenment, something such as a state, an object of some sort. That which in us desires liberation is not an individual, but freedom itself. And freedom can choose anything.

Love,

Francis
