# How do we get the superimposition of the personal perceiver to cease? - Francis Answers - 61

Francis, In your answer to question 27, you said that the cessation of the superimposition of the personal perceiver onto consciousness is necessary for apperception to take place. My question then is, how do we get the superimposition of the personal perceiver to cease?

Dear Violet,

It is you, who, exercising your sovereign freedom, choose to superimpose the belief in a personal, objective and limited perceiver upon the infinite and eternal awareness that you are. The short answer to your question is: the superimposition stops when you are open to stopping it. That means the ending of our personal pet project. Liberation is the death of the personal entity. There is however a problem: everybody wants liberation, but nobody wants to die.

A longer answer is: by investigating the question &quot;how do I know that awareness is limited to and by a specific body-mind? What is my evidence of it?&quot; This investigation has to explore only first hand, experiential evidence, and to do so thoroughly, both at the level of thoughts and at the level of sensations.

Love,

Francis
