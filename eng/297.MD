# Do I have any choice but to live in a way that is unhealty for my body and mind? - Francis Answers - 158

Location: London&nbsp;

Question: Since attending a meditation retreat ten years ago and experiencing some very powerful energetic feelings which made me sure of being a part of the whole, I now have a constant inner sound like a distant whistle which increases when I shut my eyes. I also get pressure in my head and when I meditate I feel (or imagine) a cleansing process. Despite this I over eat (Binge) and still get tangled up in thoughts. It seems that I do not have any power to change my bad habits. Is the case that I am not an individual so I do not have any choice but to live in a way that is unhealty for my body and mind?

Dear Ben,

As long as you believe to be a separate individual, do your best to live a healthy life. As a separate individual, you have still given yourself some relative freedom. Use it to respect your body as a creation of the Divine. But, most importantly, use it to apply most of your energy to the self inquiry.

Love, Francis
