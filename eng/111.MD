# Does the universal consciousness bear any of the marks that we think of as the illusory, egoic self? - Francis Answers - 58

Question:

>_In your reply to the Sept. 3 post, "Can We Change the Waking Dream?," you replied, "If the pronoun [you] refers to consciousness, which is the creator of all dreams, then the "you" which creates a dream can change it as it creates it." But I find this slightly wry, inasmuch as the "you" is hardly discrete or an agent in the way in which we think of action-requiring-agency. Does the "you" in this sense bear any of the marks that we think of as the illusory (egoic) "you"?_

Dear Stephen,

The answer is yes, the "you" in this sense does bear many of the marks that we think of as the illusory (egoic) "you". Here are a few of these marks: It is that which perceives the night dreams and the waking dreams. It is that which is aware of being conscious. It is that which thinks, both in the sense that it creates the thoughts and that it perceives them. It is that which loves. It is that which understands. I have opened the list for you, there are more marks. It is up to you to find them as an exercise.

Love,

Francis
