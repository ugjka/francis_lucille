# What do I do when I am not motivated to seek Truth? - Francis Answers - 159

Question: I understand that one needs to be very motivated to find Truth. I sometimes think I am not motivated enough or not disciplined enough. What to do?

Dear Tom,

During these moments when you are not motivated to find Truth, you are motivated by something else. Enjoy it, for as long as it lasts. Seeking is not your primary duty, happiness is.

Love,&nbsp;

Francis
