# Where does the need to create this illusion come from? - Francis Answers - 29



  







Question: It has become completely clear that our life is only an illusion and is devoid of any solid reality. Here is the question: where does the need to create this illusion come from?





  







Answer: Let's assume that I am dreaming and that the question arises: &quot;why am I creating this dream?&quot; The moment this question appears, dreaming stops. The question refers now to a past event, the dream. Clearly, the real answer to this question cannot be found among the elements of the dream, for they are not real. For instance, the answer: &quot;I was creating this dream to seduce the beautiful women who was appearing in it&quot; is obviously absurd.&nbsp;





  







Let's now go back to your question which I reformulate as follows: &quot;Given that all phenomena are illusory, what is the real cause for their creation?&quot; Obviously, this real cause cannot be an illusory phenomenon. The only non phenomenal element of our experience is our awareness, our presence, which is therefore the only remaining candidate for &quot;cause of&quot; or &quot;origin of the need for&quot; the creation of illusion. Our awareness is therefore the answer to the question. However this question in fact doesn't arise: when we are knowingly the answer, all questions vanish.
