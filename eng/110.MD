# Can we change the waking dream? - Francis Answers - 57

Question: Hello Francis I heard Tony Parsons saying that while asleep & dreaming you cannot change your dream. The same in this dream life (the second dream) you cannot change it. So what is your opinion? Regards Victor

Dear Victor,

It all depends on what you mean by "you" in your question. If this pronoun refers to consciousness, which is the creator of all dreams

, then

 the "you" which creates a dream can change it as it creates it.

But if it refers to a non-existent limited entity, itself an illusion within the dream, this "you" which is dreamt cannot change the dream to which it belongs, just as a character within a movie cannot change the ending of the movie.
