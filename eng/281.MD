# On Love and Death - Francis Answers - 148

>Hi Francis....I would so much appreciate it if you could tell me how I can confidently know that the universe is composed of love, when sometimes, I experience peace and harmony, and other times I experience the contracted fear that comes with identification with body and form, yet the experience of this all pervading love has not yet revealed itself. Thank you so much for your time and wisdom!

Dear Rosemary,

When you believe that you are mortal you don't know love, and when you know love you don't believe that you are mortal. How do you know consciousness dies? In the absence of evidence, just stop believing it does.

Love,

Francis
