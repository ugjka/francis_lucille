# Why am I not aware of sensations/thoughts in other body minds if there is only one awareness? - Francis Answers -40

Question: I can see/know/realize that I am not this body/sensations/thoughts, but that the body/mind/thoughts rather show up in the awareness that I am. 

1. However, since I can only experience sensations and thoughts that arise in this body/mind, doesn't that imply that  awareness is localized? 

2. Why am I not aware of sensations/thoughts in other body minds if there is only one Self/awareness? 

Thanks

1. As a matter of fact, the sensations and thoughts that you experience arise in your awareness, not in your body/mind. The body/mind itself arises in awareness in the form of sensations and thoughts.That which arises within awareness cannot give you any valid information on the awareness to which it appears, just as the images of the moon appearing through a telescope cannot give us any information on the gender or the age of the astronomer who observes them.

2. The fact that you don't recollect being aware of other sensations and thoughts doesn't imply that you weren't aware of them. Do you remember what you were doing 10 years ago, on the same day, at the same time? I guess not. Does that imply you weren't aware of anything then?

Warmest regards,

Francis
