# Francis answers - 246 - Where is Consciousness when the body-mind is asleep and not dreaming, and where is Consciousness with regard to the human corpse?

Name: Kati

Location: Kent in United Kingdom

>Dear Francis May I put two questions to you? 1/Where is Consciousness when the body-mind is asleep and not dreaming, and where is Consciousness with regard to the human corpse? 2/ Can humans hurt Consciousness-the Universal Love-with their vicious, hurtful, ignorant thoughts and actions? Looking forward to your answers, Kati

Dear Kati,

1. Consciousness is always within itself, no matter whether the body-mind is waking, dreaming or in deep sleep. It is a space of its own, located both beyond the usual space-time continuum and beyond the mind, and in which both appear. The human corpse belongs to space-time, and it is perceived by consciousness through the mind.

2. No, they can't.

Love, Francis
