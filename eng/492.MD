The point is that the reality of consciousness, that which is perceiving these words right now, which is also that which perceives everything we know, is beyond the shadow of a doubt. Whatever we perceive is﻿ less real than or at best as real as the consciousness that perceives it.
If we assume that the perceived world that apparently surrounds us is real, its reality must be the same as the reality of the consciousness with which it interacts in the act of perception, for if the world and consciousness didn't share the﻿ same reality, such an interaction would be impossible.

If we agree so far that consciousness and the world share the same reality, the next step is to investigate from our direct experience of consciousness (the only experience of it there﻿ is) the nature of its its reality, until we get the absolute and experiential conviction that consciousness is its own reality.
