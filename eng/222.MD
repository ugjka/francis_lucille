# A follow up on Question 111 - Francis Answers - 122



  




 







Dear Francis:

My question is whether the natural body and what is superimposed on it, leading to error of perception,&nbsp;are both illusions from the perspective of consciousness, given that&nbsp;what is superimposed is a vritti (as an imagination, a thought,&nbsp;would be, would it not?),&nbsp;but that, at the same time,&nbsp;the reality of it (the vritti) and of the physical world (the natural object that undergoes&nbsp;the superimposition by the mind) is consciousness - would you not say this? The subject matter, and the answer you gave to Q. 111,&nbsp;would then be the same or closely related.&nbsp;

Alberto.

Yes, dear Alberto, I think you are getting it. Just to make sure: it doesn't matter whether or not the &quot;external&quot; world &quot;really&quot; has its existence within or without the mind, because from the vantage point of the TV set of consciousness-reality both mind and world are only images appearing on the screen. It is impossible for an illusion (the world) to &quot;really&quot; appear within or without another illusion (the mind). The question vanishes as meaningless.

Love,

Francis
