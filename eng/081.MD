>Hi Francis You said in your Advaita Channel answer no.19 "Maya is the power of the Self that creates the world and the individual minds." How do we know that? Do intersubjective agreements help in this regard? Infinite Gratitude Maher

As the self sees itself in its own glory, it knows that consciousness is all there is. As a result, everything else, including the world and the individual minds, can only be an appearance in the mirror of Presence. Intersubjective agreements help in creating this illusion, not in getting rid of it.
