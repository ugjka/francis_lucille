Question: Through the self-realization process, does the conditioned mind eventually cease to manifest, thereby making mind made suffering an impossibility?

Dear David,

A large part of the conditioning of the body mind is useful and doesn't disappear as a result of our stabilization in our true identity. We still know how to drive or speak language. Only that part which was a by-product of ignorance dissolves with the removal of ignorance, and ignorance made suffering vanishes with it.

Love,

Francis
