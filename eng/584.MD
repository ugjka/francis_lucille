Dear Heeso,

There is no "one size fits all" answer to this question. In most cases, especially in the case of two lovers arguing, I would choose 3.

If there is a disproportionate physical abuse, an adult beating a child or a woman for example, I would choose 2 first, and then 1, telling them that the police are coming and that they should stop.

If we are talking about psychologically hurting others, I would talk to A and B or perhaps just to B.

In all cases my line of conduct would be guided by the circumstances.

Love,

Francis
