Question: Dear Francis, 

When you see A hurting B, what are you going to do?




&nbsp;




1 Tell A to stop or ask A why?




&nbsp;




2 Call the police?




&nbsp;




3 Leave them to take care of whatever issue themselves?




  








&nbsp;




I wonder what is the &quot;right&quot; thing to do, if there is such thing.. 

Thanks. Heesoo




  







Dear Heeso,





  








There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; answer to this question. In most cases, especially in the case of two lovers arguing, I would choose 3.






  








If there is a disproportionate physical abuse, an adult beating a child or a woman for example, I would choose 2 first, and then 1, telling them that the police are coming and that they should stop.






  








If we are talking about psychologically hurting others, I would talk to A and B or perhaps just to B.






  








In all cases my line of conduct would be guided by the circumstances.






  








Love,






Francis
